👋 Hi, I’m phil, software developer from Germany.
Coding C# for work and Rust 🦀 for pleasure.

I’m interested in working with markdown files hence my projects:
- ☑️ [modo](https://github.com/philphilphil/modo) - CLI to query todos in markdown files.
- 📋 [downcel](https://github.com/philphilphil/downcel) - md table calculations with excel-like formulas.
- ⭕ [jira-to-md-todo](https://github.com/philphilphil/jira-to-md-todo) - Tiny app that synchronizes Jira tickets into a markdown file as to-dos.
- ∧ [obsidian-standardform](https://github.com/philphilphil/obsidian-standardform) - Obsidian plugin that transforms Standard Form logical syntax into clean tables. 

Other projects:
- 📰 [RSS2Pushover](http://github.com/philphilphil/RSS2Pushover) - Small app which reads an RSS feed and sents new entries to Pushover.
- ♟️ [Spot](https://github.com/philphilphil/Spot) - (very bad) chess engine for fun.
- 💬 [discord_channel_cleaner](https://github.com/philphilphil/discord_channel_cleaner) - Deletes messages in discord channels.

Libraries:
- [md-todo-rs](https://github.com/philphilphil/md-todo-rs) - Rust library to gather todos in markdown files.
